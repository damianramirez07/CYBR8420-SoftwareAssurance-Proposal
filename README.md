# Software Assurance Project - CYBR8420-850 (24FA)

## Overview
This repository contains the collaborative efforts of our team for the Software Assurance class (CYBR8420-850). The primary focus of this project is to analyze an open-source software's security features and threats, within the context of a hypothetical operational environment. The project includes tasks such as threat modeling, security feature evaluation, and project planning.

## Project Structure
- **Project Proposal:** [project-proposal.md](./project-proposal.md) - Contains our project proposal outlining the open-source software selection, environment description, perceived threats, security features, and team reflection.
- **Task Assignments & Collaboration:** The GitHub Project Board is used to track internal task assignments and team collaboration. [View Project Board](https://github.com/users/mhenke/projects/3).
- **Diagrams:** Systems engineering view and other visual representations of the project's operational environment are included.

## Open-Source Software: [Name of Software]
- **Description:** A brief description of the selected open-source software project, its purpose, and usage.
- **Languages/Platforms:** Programming languages and platforms used in the software development.
- **Contributors:** Information about the contributors and activity level of the project.

## Hypothetical Operational Environment
Our project focuses on simulating the software in a [home/office/enterprise/government] operational environment. The environment assumes specific security needs and user expectations, which guide the security analysis.

## Key Components
- **Threat Assessment:** Identification of perceived security threats in the operational environment.
- **Security Features:** Evaluation of the software’s current security measures.
- **Security History:** Overview of known vulnerabilities and security-related decisions within the software’s lifecycle.
