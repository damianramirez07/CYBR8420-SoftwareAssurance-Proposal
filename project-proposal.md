# Project Proposal: Software Assurance for Open-Source Software

## 1. Introduction
- Briefly introduce the open-source software project your team has selected.
  - Create T3 App is an open-source project designed to streamline the setup of full-stack, typesafe Next.js applications. This CLI tool allows you to quickly scaffold a modular T3 Stack app tailored to your specific needs.
  - The T3 Stack includes technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, and NextAuth.js2. Each component is optional, giving you the flexibility to include only what you need for your project.
- State the purpose of the proposal and the goals for this assignment.

## 2. Open-Source Project Selection
- **Project Name:** [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)
- **Description:** Interactive CLI to start a full-stack, typesafe Next.js app.
  - The _"T3 Stack"_ is a web development stack made by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**.
- **Project Details:**
  - Contributors (90 days as of 8/20/2024)
    - Outside Contributors 19 
  - Activity (How active is the project? Regular updates?)
    - Medium activity
    - 22 commits
    - Average per week 3.1 
  - Use (Who uses this software? How popular is it?)
    - It is widely used by developers who value typesafety and modularity in their full-stack applications. The stack is particularly popular among those building modern web applications with a focus on performance and developer experience.
    - The project has gained significant traction since its inception. For instance, within just a few months of its launch, it amassed thousands of stars on GitHub.
  - Programming languages, platforms, and tools used.
    - [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org): Ensures type safety and enhances the developer experience with static typing.
    - JavaScript: Used alongside TypeScript, especially in the context of Next.js.
    - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
    - Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
    - [Prisma](https://prisma.io): An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database management.
    - [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team): An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database management.
    - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
    - [tRPC](https://trpc.io): A library for building end-to-end typesafe APIs.
    - [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org): A library for authentication in Next.js applications.
  - Documentation sources (e.g., GitHub, OpenHub).
