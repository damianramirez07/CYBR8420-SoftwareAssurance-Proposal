# Project Proposal: Software Assurance for Open-Source Software

## 1. Introduction
- Briefly introduce the open-source software project your team has selected.
- State the purpose of the proposal and the goals for this assignment.

## 2. Open-Source Project Selection
- **Project Name:**  [T3 create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)
- **Description:** Interactive CLI to start a full-stack, typesafe Next.js app.
  - The _"T3 Stack"_ is a web development stack made by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**. It consists of: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [tRPC](https://trpc.io), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), [Prisma](https://prisma.io), [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team), and [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- **Project Details:**
  - Contributors (90 days as of 8/20/2024)
    - Outside Contributors 19 
  - Activity (How active is the project? Regular updates?)
    - Medium activity
    - 22 commits
    - Average per week 3.1 
  - Use (Who uses this software? How popular is it?)
  - Programming languages, platforms, and tools used.
  - Documentation sources (e.g., GitHub, OpenHub).
- **Team Motivation:** Describe why your team chose this project.

## 3. Hypothetical Operational Environment
